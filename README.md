A few campus map apps already exist, but the most popular one, Campus Maps, is pretty ugly and doesn't really consider how the user will interact with the app. The original motivation for this prototype app was to create a cleaner user interface along with a more intuitive way of organizing a campus' facilities, allowing the user to find their destination as quick as possible.
